# flize

flize implements epoch-based reclamation with less restrictions than `crossbeam-epoch`.

A primary goal of this crate so to have a very rusty API and
to have clear and simple source code.

This crate is useful if you have resources that require destruction
in a concurrent environment and you don't want to pay the price of locking.
